Getting NeverBlock mysql to work on Rails 2.3.0 RC and Ruby 1.9.1.

NeverBlock now uses ActiveRecord's ConnectionPool instead of defining its own
version. It should also work on Rails 2.2 ActiveRecord but Rails 2.2 doesn't
work on Ruby 1.9.1 so I had to use Rails 2.3.0 RC.

This commit will break support for earlier versions of Rails.

PG support is still to come.
